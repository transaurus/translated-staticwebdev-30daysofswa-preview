# Roadmap

Welcome to **#30DaysOfSWA** - a fun way to jumpstart your learning journey into Azure Static Web Apps. 

Over the next four weeks, we'll learn core concepts, see usage examples, explore developer tools, and discuss best practices to design richer end-to-end user experiences. We've put together a tentative plan for the content. While the weekly themes are fixed, we may adapt or alter planned posts in response to your feedback or requests.

So share your questions, comments and suggestions. Help us make this more journey better!
 * **Preferred**: Post feedback to our [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/staticwebdev/discussions/categories/-30daysofswa) board. 
 * Alternatively, post feedback as comments in the related post [on dev.to](https://dev.to/nitya/series/17901).
 * You can also tweet comments or share learnings using the `#30DaysOfSWA` hashtag.
