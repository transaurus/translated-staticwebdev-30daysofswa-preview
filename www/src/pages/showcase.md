## Community Showcase

We're working on a new **Community Showcase** site where you can discover real-world applications and code samples contributed by the developer community. You should be able to:
 * Filter by tags to see examples for specific front-end frameworks and static site generators
 * Filter by "open source" to see projects that have links to source code, for inspiration.
 * Add your project, to inspire others and celebrate your achievements!

Here's a sneak peek at what that will look like. Stay tuned for more details.
