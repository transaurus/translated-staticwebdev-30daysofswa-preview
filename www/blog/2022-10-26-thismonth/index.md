## Product News

_This section covers recent news or announcements from the product team. Read on to learn the latest news from the world of Azure Static Web Apps!_ 

* **Oct 03** | [Universal Rendering with Nuxt 3 and Azure Static Web Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/universal-rendering-with-nuxt-3-and-azure-static-web-apps/ba-p/3586297?WT.mc_id=javascript-74011-ninarasi). Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity. [**Get Started**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/deploy-nuxtjs?WT.mc_id=javascript-74011-ninarasi) with this tutorial.
