## Prelude - SWAanniversary and the birth of #30DaysOfSWA
The #30DaysOfSWA blog series started off on Apr 30 with [this post](./2022-04-30.md) announcing the **SWA Anniversary** event, before [**kicking off**](./2022-05-01.md) the **#30DaysOfSWA** on May 1, then completing four themed weeks of content, publishing **one new blog everyday**. The intent of the series is to take a developer from zero to hero. You can [**find the entire roadmap here**](/roadmap).

On 19th and 20th May, we celebrated the [#SWAanniversary](https://www.azurestaticwebapps.dev/blog/swanniversary?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall) to commemorate a year of Static Web App's **General Availability**! It was a fun-and-engaging event featuring **top community speakers**, and the latest SWA feature demos! 

:::success ANNOUNCEMENT: SWA CLI V1.0 RELEASED!üöÄ
On May 19th, we also witnessed a big announcement - **the General Availability (GA) of SWA CLI**!! Try out the [SWA CLI](https://aka.ms/swa-cli-ga?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall), deploy your amazing Static Web Apps, and tell us about your experience!üåπ
