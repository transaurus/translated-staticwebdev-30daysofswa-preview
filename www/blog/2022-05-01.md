## Hello #30DaysOfSWA

Simply put, it's a month-long series of blog posts that provides you a curated and structured tour through the universe of  [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview?WT.mc_id=30daysofswa-61155-cxall). 

 * Each article will be 5 mins or less in reading time
 * Each ends with an activity to help reinforce the learning
 * Articles will follow a structured roadmap over 4 weeks

We've organized the journey into four stages, each building on the previous one in a way that mimics the developer experience with any new technology:
 * **Week 1:** Focus on Core Concepts, learning terminology and getting setup.
 * **Week 2:** Focus on Usage Examples with quickstarts & front-end technologies.
 * **Week 3:** Focus on Dev Tools to develop, debug, test, and deploy, the SWA!
 * **Week 4:** Focus on Best Practices, from services to end-to-end experiences.

## Week 1 Roadmap

We are kicking off week 1 with a focus on **Core Concepts** to get you familiar with the high-level architecture, fundamental components and basic terminology for Azure Static Web Apps. Want a sneak peek at the topics? Here's a visual guide to help you!

**By the end of week 1 you should know**:
 * What Azure Static Web Apps is, and its benefits
 * How to get started building SWA or using it for your existing apps
 * How to go serverless, adding API capability with Azure Functions
 * How to configure SWA - from app behavior to build process
 * How to secure SWA - from user authentication to role-based authorization
 * How to preview SWA - on pull requests or test branches
 * How to deploy SWA - using different code sources, or CI/CD options

By the end of the week you should be familiar with SWA terminology and developer workflows - and be ready to explore usage scenarios with various front-end frameworks or static site generators!

## Take The Journey

They say it takes 30 days to make a habit. It's our hope that doing short bursts of reading and activity with Azure Static Web Apps on a daily basis, will lead to better learning and development habits in general.
