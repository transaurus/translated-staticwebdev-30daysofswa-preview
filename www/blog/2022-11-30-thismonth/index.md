## Did You Know?

_Each month, we hope to turn the spotlight on one key resource or person that is worth knowing about, in the context of Azure Static Web Apps._

:::info ðŸŒŸ SPOTLIGHT ON: Awesome AZD Templates

The Azure Developer CLI (AZD) is an open-source tool that accelerates the time it takes for you to get started on Azure - with a set of developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow (code, build, deploy, monitor).

Not only that, AZD uses extensible application templates ([Awesome AZD Templates](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/)) that include everything you need to get up and running on Azure for multiple scenarios. Each covering an end-to-end scenario that goes far beyond "Hello World!".

:::

Checkout the Static Web App enabled [Awesome AZD Templates](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/) we've created:
* [ToDo Application with a Node.js API and Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB on Static Web Apps and Functions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-nodejs-mongo-swa-func)
* [ToDo Application with a Python API and Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB on Static Web Apps and Functions](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/todo-python-mongo-swa-func)
