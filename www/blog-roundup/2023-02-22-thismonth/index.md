No matter if you are building a web app with libraries and web frameworks like Blazor, Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby, Hugo, VuePress, or basically anything that has static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), you can take advantage of Azure Static Web Apps. In this video I walk through how to create your very first Azure Static Web app, how to deploy it with GitHub actions, how to communicate with an Azure Function backend, and how to setup a full custom domain name with SSL certs! In under 30 minutes! 

* **Feb 07** | `techcommunity.microsoft.com` - [**How to setup Built-in Authentication for Azure SWA using Azure Active Directory**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-setup-built-in-authentication-for-azure-static-web-apps/ba-p/3734709?WT.mc_id=javascript-74011-ninarasi) by _Joey Huang_. Azure Static Web Apps provides 2 mechanisms for authentication: built-in auth and custom auth. It enables authentication by simply defining the routing rules and roles in the _staticwebapp.config.json_ config file. Let's walk through enabling built-in auth using Azure AD step-by-step!

But what if .. we need to do it on demand from TeamCity, or any other CI/CD tool? You can do this using [the Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli)! Learn how.

## Did You Know?

_Each month, we hope to turn the spotlight on one key resource or person that is worth knowing about, in the context of Azure Static Web Apps._

:::info ðŸŒŸ SPOTLIGHT ON:  SVELTEKIT ADAPTER FOR SWA

[**SvelteKit 1.0 was announced in Dec 2022**](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0), a milestone for the recommended way to build Svelte apps - with an [interactive tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/) to jumpstart your learning journey.

To deploy your SvelteKit app, you need to _adapt_ it to your deployment (hosting) target, using [Adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters), plugins that generate the deployment-ready site from your built app. **Did you know** SvelteKit supports some [zero-config deployment adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) by default - including **[svelte-adapter-azure-swa](https://github.com/geoffrich/svelte-adapter-azure-swa) for Azure Static Web Apps!**
